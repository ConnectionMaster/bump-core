# Bump Core (deprecated)

> Bump was an application, created by GoCardless in 2015, which helped keep project dependencies up to date.
>
> Since 2017, [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) has fulfilled the same needs, whilst offering a wider range of features and tools to teams and individuals.
>
> Dependabot is powered by [dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core), which is the spiritual successor to the bump-core project.
