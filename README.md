# Bump Core

Bump Core is a library containing the logic to keep a project's Ruby,
JavaScript and Python dependencies up to date. It is used by applications
like [Bump][bump] and [Dependabot][dependabot].

**Bump Core has now been superseded by [Dependabot Core][dependabot-core], which
we recommend for all your dependency updating needs.**
